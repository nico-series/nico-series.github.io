# nico-series.github.io

Hi!

This is intended to be a personal site, with info about myself and both professional and personal projects. 

## Thought Process
1. Static sites are just fine and dandy.
2. I can upgrade to a framework with bells and whistles when I need one, maybe a static site generator that works well with blogs.
3. I do lots of things, and should share what I've written about them, preferably with nice formatting.

## Nice To Have's
- Make articles compatible with Gutenberg
