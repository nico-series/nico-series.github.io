## Intro
Hello! I am Kristen MacIsaac, a developer and creative, and Nico-Series is a personal project of mine. If you're here, you are likely visiting either because I invited you to do so, or you found this site via my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristen-macisaac-28949a120/).

Professionally I have roughly 5 years of experience working in web development and software engineering. During my personal time, I enjoy wiki diving every topic under the sun, gardening, painting, cooking, and gaming. In both professional and personal experience, I would say I'm a bit of a generalist. I'd like to think I'm a jack of all trades, but the leaky pipe under the kitchen sink says otherwise - I believe I just have to replace and reseal the union but _I'm not certain_. 

I am curious, love to learn, and love to share what I've learned. Most of the topics discussed here are a matter of study, time investment, experimentation, and luck. Enjoy!
