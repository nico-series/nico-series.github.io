## Servings & Time
Makes 10ish bowls / fills the red pot. Assume around 3 hours in the kitchen, as you need to chop veggies, cook meat, and clean up. 

## Choosing Ingredients
Chorizo is the star of this soup. It's packed full of flavor, so you don't have to work as hard to come up with flavors on your own. Look for fresh sausages from the butcher if possible.

Chicken thighs are used to bolster the soup and add protein while not going quite as hard on cholesterol as a chorizo-only soup would. Thigh meat stands up to cooking down in soup better than breast does, so we prefer it to breast meat here. Bone-in thighs also have more flavor, so I use those and do the extra work of deboning and shredding at the end of the recipe. If you want to skip deboning, you can just use boneless thighs instead.

## Marination Directions
Marinate your chicken thighs in a thin coating of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and a healthy coating of paprika & massage it in. Let it chill in the fridge while you chop your veggies. 

## Soup Directions
1. Brown your chicken in a skillet on medium heat (6) with a thin coating of olive oil. Don't worry about cooking it all the way through - this is just to add flavor. Set it aside.
2. In your stew pot, heat the olive oil on medium heat (6). Add the onion and cook till softened. Add the garlic and cook until the onion starts to brown.
3. Add the chorizo to the pot and break it up. Once the chorizo starts to brown, add in the chicken broth, chicken, potatoes, beans, corn, and carrots. Wait on the radishes - they go in at the end. Bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a med-low simmer.
4. While your soup is simmering, fill a sauce pot up about half way with water and bring it up to a boil and add in the orzo. Cook until al dente. 
5. After it's been simmering at least 10-15 minutes, the sausage should be safe - start tasting your soup. Depending on the sausage used, you may want to modify the flavor. Consider adding more salt, smoked paprika, garlic, onion powder, oregano, or cumin. For a mild spice kick add more chili powder, or for a moderate kick add in cayenne or chipotle powder. Try a half a teaspoon of these at a time. 
6. Once the chicken is shreddable and the potatoes are done, cut off the heat, shred the chicken, and then stir in the cream cheese & radishes - I like the crisp taste radishes have if you don't cook them much. Allow it to cool for a few minutes.
7. Serve over the orzo & garnish with cilantro & lime wedges.

## Try
Try marinating the chicken longer.

It might be nice to add in peppers with the onions, this soup seems like it would get along well with peppers. Also maybe more beans.

If you like sour, zesting the limes before cutting them and adding the zest either to the soup directly or as a garnish would probably work.
