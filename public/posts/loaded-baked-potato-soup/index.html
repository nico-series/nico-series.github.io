<p>Makes 8 respectable bowls, it&rsquo;s about 3 hours in the kitchen if you count bacon, veggie chopping, and cleanup.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-ingredients">Choosing Ingredients</h2>
<p>Pick your potato of choice. Oftentimes, I go with <strong>red potatoes</strong> because I like their texture. However, a grainier, starchier potato will soften up and break down into the soup a little more, so if you like a thick, starchy soup, a <strong>russet potato</strong> may be to your preference.</p>
<p>I like to add <strong>summer sausage</strong> to this soup. It adds so much flavor when seared. You can leave it out - 1 lb of bacon is plenty of meat already - or sub it for a different sausage with a flavor you prefer. I can imagine any non-sweet breakfast sausage, italian sausage, or chorizo would be delightful.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2-3 lbs potatoes, cut into 1.5 inch pieces</li>
<li>1 lb bacon</li>
<li>8oz summer sausage</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>5 sticks celery, chopped</li>
<li>1 c carrots, chopped</li>
<li>1 head broccoli, break up florets into spoon-friendly pieces</li>
<li>1 heaping tbsp grated garlic</li>
<li>48 oz chicken broth</li>
<li>5 heaping tbs. flour</li>
<li>4 tbsp butter</li>
<li>2 cups of milk</li>
<li>1 cup of shredded cheddar</li>
<li>garlic powder to taste</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toppings">Toppings</h2>
<ul>
<li>smoked paprika to taste</li>
<li>1 bundle of green onions, chopped</li>
<li>16 oz sour cream</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cook the bacon to a decent crisp and set it aside to cool. Save or toss most of the grease but leave a coating in the pan. If you don&rsquo;t like bacon grease, olive oil works with the flavors of this soup. Sear the sausage in the same pan and set it aside as well. If you used summer sausage it&rsquo;s already cooked, so you just want to add some browning to bring out the flavor.</li>
<li>Add the onion to the bacon pan on medium (6) and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
<li>Move the onion to the soup pot. Add the chicken broth and potatoes and get it bubbling gently on medium-high heat (7-8) for 10 mins.</li>
<li>Add all chopped veggies except the onion greens &amp; broccoli. Cut down the heat to medium (6).</li>
<li>After another 5-10 mins add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Add the broccoli and reduce heat to medium-low (4). The earlier you add in the broccoli, the more it will break down into your soup.</li>
<li>In the meantime, lazy rinse the bacon pan (the onions should have more or less deglazed it already) and chop the bacon.</li>
<li>Make a light roux in the bacon pan - add the butter and milk and slowly whisk (or sift) in flour. Do your best to keep it smooth. If it comes out lumpy, that&rsquo;s OK! You can either accept the lumps, which will be disguised by the potatoes, or you can blend them together with an immersion blender. Add cheddar cheese in after the milk is combined. You want it to thicken up mildly - think pudding, but not hummus.</li>
<li>The veggies should be cooked and the potatoes should be fork-tender. The broth should have boiled down a fair bit such that some of the veggies poke above the surface. Stir in the roux, bacon, and garlic and cook for a few minutes until it is thoroughly combined. Keeping in mind that it will continue to thicken after it is taken off the heat, remove it from heat before it reaches the desired consistency. Let it cool, stirring every few mins, until it reaches an edible temperature.</li>
<li>Top with onion greens, smoked paprika, and sour cream and serve.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternative---loaded-chicken--potato-soup">Alternative - Loaded Chicken &amp; Potato Soup</h2>
<p>Near the end, add in cooked chicken as well. You can either cook it and season it yourself or use a rotisserie bird. Like with sausage, any seasoning from your meat will contribute to the soup, so keep spices harmonious. If you aren&rsquo;t adventurous, a standard standard holiday bird combo of salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and sage will work. Cook it until it&rsquo;s just barely done in the bacon grease or olive oil. If your chicken is refrigerated, add it in a few minutes before you remove the soup from heat. If it&rsquo;s hot off the stove, add it in after it&rsquo;s been removed from the heat and allow residual heat from the soup to finish it.</p>
<p>You can also add <strong>frozen peas</strong> around the time you&rsquo;d add broccoli.</p>
<p>You could also try using <strong>ranch seasoning</strong> instead of the base seasonings. It feels correct.</p>
